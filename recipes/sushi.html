    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spicy Crab Roll is a popular Japanese sushi roll – creamy, satisfying, and fiery spicy. The kani crab stick is shredded and then seasoned with sriracha spicy mayo, then wrapped in nori seaweed sheets and seasoned rice. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sushi rice</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp sushi vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>4 oz kani crab meat</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori seaweed</li>
        <li>2 2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the rice and add to the rice cooker. Then add water and cook according to the instructions.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, transfer to a large bowl and let it cool. When it’s still very warm, mix in the sushi vinegar (or the mixture of rice vinegar, sugar and salt).</li>
      <li>In a clear bowl, mix together Sriracha sauce and mayonnaise. Taste and add more Sriracha if you prefer a spicier flavor.</li>
      <li>Shred the imitation crab meat using your hands or two forks. Add Sriracha mayo and mix well.</li>
      <li>Cut the nori sheet into two halves with kitchen scissors.</li>
      <li>Place half of a nori sheet on top of the bamboo mat shiny side facing down.</li>
      <li>Spread seasoned sushi rice (about 3/4 cup) over nori evenly. Press the rice gently with your hands. (Tips: You can dip your hands in Tezu water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands).</li>
      <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of the rice.</li>
      <li>Flip the sheet and let the rice side facing down.</li>
      <li>Add the spicy Kani crab salad to the middle of the nori sheet.</li>
      <li>Place the thumbs underneath the bamboo mat and lift the edge up and over the filling.</li>
      <li>Roll the bamboo mat away from you and press the rice and filling together. Keep rolling until the ends meet.</li>
      <li>More the roll to a cutting board and cut it into 8 pieces.</li>
      <li>Drizzle more spicy mayo sauce on top of the roll for some extra heat.</li>
    </ol>
